# Cholesterol

  LDL = Low density lipoprotein ("bad cholesterol")
    LDL(a) = Pattern A = Large, buouyant LDL (neutral)
    LDL(b) = Pattern B = VLDL = Small, dense, Very low density (actually bad)
      Raised by carbohydrates consumption
  HDL = High density lipoprotein ("good cholesterol")

# How to check for LDL type

  Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio.

  Predicts heart disease risk better than cholesterol levels
  Triglyceride low,  high HDL == OK (you have neutral LDL)
  Triglyceride high, low  HDL == Bad

# 1982 low-fat diet craze increased carbohydrate consumption:

  Low-fat processed food:
    tastes like crap, so it's sugared to taste better

  Adulteration of our food supply:
    Fat is substituted by carbohydrates by
      Either HFCL (55% fructose),
      or Sucrose (50% fructose)

    Changes done:
      Fructose is added for:
        Palatability
        Browning agent
          It browns better because of protein glycation
          Protein glycation leads to athleroscrelosis
          (What happens in your steak, also happens in your arteries)

      Removed fiber:
        For shelf life
        Freezing
          (Fast food = fibreless food)

      Substitution of trans-fats:
        Hardening agent, shelf life
        Now being removed for CVD risk

# Fructose vs glucose

  Fructose browns 7x better than glucose to form Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)
  Fructose does not suppress ghrelin (hunger hormone)
    (If you drink soda before buying food, you eat more)
  Acute fructose does not stimulate insulin, or leptin
    Your brain doesn't see that you ate something
    No transport for fructose on the beta cell
  Hepatic fructose metabolism is different
  Chronic fructose exposure promotes the Metabolic Syndrome
    Obesity, Type 2, lipid problems, hypertension, CVD

# Glucose metabolism

  So what happens when you eat 120cal of glucose (2 slices of bread)?

  80% will be used by all organs of the body
    Every cell in the body can use glucose
    (Glucose = energy of life)
  20% will be on the liver
    Goes through Glu2 transport
    Pancreas creates Insulin
    Glucose-6-P will be in the liver
    Will be converted to Glycogen in the liver
    Liver can store as much glycogen as it can!
    Eventually becomes VLDL (probably 0.5 cal of it)
    Insulin went up => tells brain to stop eating

# Ethanol metabolism

  Ethanol (CH(3)-CH(2)-OH) is a carbohydrate and a toxin
    Ethanol is metabolised in the brain which causes weird things
    Ethanol is fermented sugar?

  So what happens when you ingest 120cal of ethanol?

  10% stomach/intestines (first pass effect)
  10% kidney, muscle, brain
  80% liver (4 times of glucose)
    Becomes acetaldahyde (gets you sirhosis by damaging proteins in the liver)
    FFA in muscles (causing insulin resistance in your muscles)

# Sucrose metabolism

  What happens when you ingest 120cal of sucrose (glass of orange juice)?

    60cal glucose
      20% on liver ... (see above)

    60cal fructose
      100% on liver (!)
      Glu5 transport (instead of Glu2)
      ATP (and shit) becomes uric acid
        Causes gout and hypertension

# Intervention

  Remove sugared liquids aside from milk
  Wait 20 minutes for second portions
    To get a satiety signal
  Eat your carbohydrate with fiber (can nullify bad fructose effects)
    Fiber is supposed to be an essential nutrient
  Buy your screen time for physical activity

# Why is exercise good for obese people?

  Improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity
  Reduces stress
  It makes the TCA cycle (krebs cycle) run faster (!)
    Citrate doesn't leave mitochondria (and turn into fat)
    This is what they mean by 'higher metabolism'

# Why is fiber important in obesity?

  **Eat your carbohydrate with fiber**
    "When God made the poison, he packaged it with an antidote."
    Whenever fructose is found in nature, it comes with fiber

  Reduces intestinal carbohydrate absorption rate
    Reduced rate => bacteria gets to it
    (Life gives you 2 choices: fat, or fart)
  Increases speed of transit of ntestinal contents to insulin
  Inhibits absorption of some FFA to the colon

  Paleolithic diet cures type 2 diabetes! Fiber! :D

# Fructosification of America and the world

  McDo doesn't have HFCS in:
    French fries (salt, starch and fat)
    Hash browns (same)
    Chicken McNuggets (same)
    Sausage
    Diet coke
    Coffee
    Iced tea (without sugar)

  None of the elite athletes drink Gatorade

  Low fat milk (1%)
    Has HFCS! Wtf?

  Isomic (milk formula)
    has 43% corn syrup solids (Coke has 10.5% sucrose)
    The more sugar you use as a kid, the more you crave for it later

  Can of Coke vs can of beer
    150cal vs 150cal
    10.5% sucrose vs 3.6% alcohol
    90cal to liver vs 92cal

# Conclusion

  Fructose is:
    a carb
    metabolized like fat
      Corollary: a high-fat diet is a high-fructose diet
    a chronic hepatotoxin
      "Fructose is alcohol without the buzz"
      you get sick after 1000 fructose meals, not 1
